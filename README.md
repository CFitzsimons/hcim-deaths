HCIM Deaths
===========

An OS project devoted to tracking and announcing HCIM deaths.  Based on the original concept from the (now deactivated) twitter account "HCIM Deaths" - https://mobile.twitter.com/hcim_deaths?lang=en


Objectives / Roadmap
----------

Ever since the discontinuation of the HCIM death announcement Twitter account I've wanted to create something similar but make it open source so the community can work together to keep the project alive.  This is all completely orignal code but the concept was 100% inspired by the original Twitter account.  

My goal is to not only support the skill based highscores but also clue scrolls, boss kills and anything else I can manage to track.  

- [ ] Top 1000 overall
- [ ] Top 100 in each skill, boss kill, etc.
